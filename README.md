# Swift-VIPER-Template
VIPER Templates written in Swift 3. I used something similar but I'm fine tuning these templates still. Feel free to use them. 

Go to VIPERXcodeTemplates/ and run `make install_templates` to install them into Xcode templates. Then you can create a module useing File>New from Xcode
